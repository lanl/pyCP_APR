**pyCP_APR** is a Python library for tensor decomposition and anomaly detection that is developed as part of the R&D 100 award wining `SmartTensors AI <https://smart-tensors.lanl.gov/software/>`_ project. It is designed for the fast analysis of large datasets by accelerating computation speed using GPUs. pyCP_APR uses the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) tensor factorization algorithm utilizing both Numpy and PyTorch backend. While the Numpy backend can be used for the analysis of both sparse and dense tensors, PyTorch backend provides faster decomposition of large and sparse tensors on the GPU. pyCP_APR's Scikit-learn like API allows comfortable interaction with the library, and include the methods for anomaly detection via the p-values obtained from the CP-APR factorization. The anomaly detection methods via the p-values optained from CP-APR was introduced by Eren et al. in :cite:p:`Eren2020_ISI` using the `Unified Host and Network Dataset <https://csr.lanl.gov/data/2017/>`_  :cite:p:`UnifiedHostandNetwork2018`. Our work follows the `MATLAB Tensor Toolbox <https://www.tensortoolbox.org/cp.html>`_  :cite:p:`TTB_Software,Bader2006,Bader2008` implementation of CP-APR :cite:p:`ChKo12`.

Example Usage
========================================
.. code-block:: python

    from pyCP_APR import CP_APR
    from pyCP_APR.datasets import load_dataset

    # Load a sample tensor
    data = load_dataset(name="TOY")
    coords_train, nnz_train = data['train_coords'], data['train_count']
    coords_test, nnz_test = data['test_coords'], data['test_count']

    # CP-APR Object with PyTorch backend on a GPU. Transfer the latent factors back to Numpy arrays.
    model = CP_APR(n_iters=10,
                   random_state=42,
                   verbose=1,
                   method='torch',
                   device='gpu',
                   return_type='numpy')

    # Train a rank 45 tensor
    M = model.fit(coords=coords_train, values=nnz_train, rank=45)

    # Predict the scores over the trained tensor
    y_score = model.predict_scores(coords=coords_test, values=nnz_test)
